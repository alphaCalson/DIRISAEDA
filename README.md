# **Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Screening Enhancement**

This project explores strategies to improve the current tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and screening processes, particularly in underserved communities. Using insights from data analysis and research, we propose the integration of **portable CT scanners** and **machine learning (ML) models** to enable early detection and streamline the diagnostic flow.

## **Background**
Tuberculosis remains a leading global health issue, particularly in low-resource settings. Current diagnosis methods are often time-consuming and require access to specialized healthcare facilities. Leveraging portable technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to transform the TB detection process.

---

## **Objectives**
- Improve early TB detection in poor communities using advanced technologies.
- Utilize ML models for optimized diagnostic workflows.
- Enhance the accessibility and accuracy of TB screenings.

---

## **Proposed Solution**
1. **Portable CT Scanners**: Deploy low-cost, portable scanners in underserved areas.
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Develop ML models to analyze CT scans and detect TB at earlier stages.
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Leverage community health data to continuously refine diagnostic accuracy.

---

## **Research Insights**
- **Key Recommendations**:
  - Focus on early detection to mitigate the spread and impact of TB.
  - Utilize portable diagnostic tools to reach marginalized populations.
  - Integrate ML models to analyze CT images and provide real-time feedback to healthcare workers.

- **Supporting Evidence**:
  - Floyd et al. (2018) highlight the importance of technological advancements in TB control.
  - WHO (2015) emphasizes global strategies like *End TB* that align with this project.
  - Esmail et al. (2014) underline the challenge of latent TB and the need for improved diagnostics.
